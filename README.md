# Image Classification Final Project Dicoding Course
This repository contains my final project for the Dicoding course on Image Classification. The project focuses on implementing deep learning techniques to perform an image classification task. In this project, I used a dataset to classify garbages into 10 categories. For the model, I utilized a pretrained DenseNet201 layer and built the architecture using a Sequential model. Additionally, the project also focuses on saving the trained model in various formats, such as SavedModel, TF-Lite, and TFJS, making it deployable across different platforms and applications."
